They're now considered a growing <strong>threat to human health</strong>, particularly through the air we breathe.</p><p>Once airborne, these microscopic fibers can be <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37971785/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>inhaled and settle deep within the lungs</strong></a>, where they may remain lodged for years. Research shows just how small these particles are: nylon microfibers as tiny as <strong>12 × 31 μm</strong> and polyester fibers up to <strong>15 × 52 μm</strong> have been detected floating in indoor environments [1][2].</p><p>This isn’t just theoretical. In a study of autopsies, <strong>97% of lung tissue samples</strong> from patients with chronic respiratory disease were found to contain <strong>synthetic fibers</strong> [3].</p><p>And the danger isn’t limited to factories or high-exposure jobs. Everyday environments—our homes, closets, and laundry rooms—are part of the problem. A <strong>15-minute cycle in a typical household dryer</strong> can release over <strong>500,000 microfibers </strong>into the air [6]. Once suspended, they can linger in indoor spaces where most of us spend the majority of our time. In fact, indoor air has up to 8 times more microplastics than the outdoors [7].</p><p>Long-term exposure to these particles has been linked to <strong>reduced lung function</strong>, <strong>pulmonary fibrosis</strong>, and <strong>early-onset emphysema</strong>—especially in people with constant exposure, like textile workers, where 15–40% develop work-related respiratory illness [4][5].</p><p>At <a href=\"https://armsofandes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Arms of Andes</strong></a>, we believe performance wear shouldn’t compromise your breath. That’s why we make garments with 100% natural alpaca wool, a breathable fiber that doesn’t release plastic particles—so you can move freely without inhaling synthetic harm.</p>",

These particles are now found in the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink, making accidental ingestion almost impossible to avoid [3].<br/></p><p>Once inside the gastrointestinal tract, microplastics can do more than simply pass through. Research shows that they can <strong>trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, and disturb the gut microbiome</strong>—the vital ecosystem of bacteria that supports digestion, immunity, and overall well-being [3,11].<br/></p><p>But the impact doesn’t stop there. A study published in Environmental Health Perspectives revealed that microplastics can <strong>translocate</strong>—moving from the gut into distant <strong>organs like the liver, kidneys, and even the brain</strong> [3,12]. This suggests a far-reaching, systemic exposure that affects more than just the digestive system.<br/></p><p>If you're someone who values clean nutrition, gut balance, and high performance from the inside out, it’s worth considering that the fibers in your clothes may be adding more than comfort to your life. Wearing synthetic fabrics—especially next to the skin—can contribute to microplastic ingestion through fiber shedding, especially during physical activity.<br/></p><h3>Microplastics and Gut Microbiome Imbalance<br/></h3><p>The <strong>gut microbiome</strong>—a vast community of trillions of microorganisms living in the digestive tract—is central to human health. It helps regulate inflammation, process nutrients, support the immune system, and even influence mood and metabolism.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>But this finely tuned ecosystem is highly sensitive to disruption.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Once ingested, these microscopic particles can disrupt the microbial balance of the gut, a condition known as <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12006732/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>dysbiosis</strong></a> [13]. When dysbiosis occurs, harmful bacteria begin to outcompete beneficial ones. This imbalance can weaken the gut’s ability to regulate key processes, leaving the body more vulnerable to inflammation, poor nutrient absorption, and weakened immune defense [14].<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Over time, this disruption may contribute to chronic digestive conditions. In fact, studies have linked nylon fiber exposure to an increased risk of inflammatory bowel diseases like <strong>Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis</strong> [3].<strong><br/></strong></p><p>While the connection between textiles and gut health may not be immediately obvious, it’s a reminder that the materials we live in daily have deeper consequences than surface comfort. Clothing isn't just a layer—it’s part of our exposure.</p>",

This is particularly relevant as rates of EOCRC continue to rise globally, especially in younger populations.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Though a definitive causal relationship has not yet been confirmed, the findings are enough to raise red flags. They add to a growing body of evidence that microplastic exposure can have long-term consequences for digestive and overall health.<br/></p><h3>Skin Deep: Allergies, Infections & Hormonal Exposure from Synthetic Clothes</h3><h3>Skin Irritation and Synthetic Fabric Allergies<br/></h3><p>Studies show that <strong>up to 70% of individuals with sensitive skin report rashes</strong>, itching, or contact dermatitis when wearing synthetic clothing, particularly during heat, humidity, or physical activity [16,17]. The culprits are often chemical additives used in the manufacturing process—such as <strong>phthalates </strong>and <strong>heavy-metal dyes</strong>—which can leach out with sweat and friction.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>For those with conditions like <strong>atopic dermatitis (eczema)</strong>, the issue can be even more pronounced. Between <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.det.2010.01.004\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>60–70% of patients with this condition</strong></a> experience worsening symptoms when wearing synthetic garments [18]. One key reason is the lack of breathability in synthetic fibers, which tend to trap moisture and heat against the skin—creating an environment that irritates rather than protects.<br/></p><h3>Infections and Bacterial Imbalance in Intimate Areas</h3><p>Synthetic fabrics like polyester, nylon, and spandex are commonly used in underwear for their stretch and form fit. But these same properties can lead to unintended consequences, especially in the intimate area.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Because they <strong>trap heat and moisture against the skin</strong>, these fabrics create a warm, humid environment ideal for the overgrowth of yeast and harmful bacteria. As a result, they significantly increase the<strong> risk of vaginal infections</strong> like candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis [19].<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Unlike natural fibers, synthetic textiles lack <strong>breathability </strong>and d<strong>o not wick moisture away </strong>effectively. This can lead not only to discomfort, but also to <strong>a disruption of the vaginal microbiome</strong>—the natural balance of bacteria that helps protect against infection [5,19].</p>",

            "richtext": "<h3>Chronic Health Risks from Synthetic Fibers</h3><p>Mounting research suggests that prolonged exposure to synthetic fibers—and the chemicals embedded within them—can affect the body far beyond the surface.<br/></p><p>As previously noted, many of these effects are especially concerning for the <strong>hormonal and endocrine systems</strong>, particularly in women. But the risks extend further.<br/></p><h3>Hormonal Imbalance and Endocrine Disruption<br/></h3><p><strong>Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)</strong> are substances that can mimic, block, or alter hormonal signals in the body—even at very low levels of exposure. And they are commonly found in synthetic textiles.<br/></p><p>One example is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34069956/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>phthalates</strong></a>, used to soften plastics and frequently detected in synthetic clothing, particularly in activewear. These chemicals can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled during wear, and have been shown to <strong>interfere with estrogen and testosterone production</strong>, potentially impacting fertility in both men and women [21,25].<br/></p><p>Another widespread EDC is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.05.002\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>bisphenol A</strong></a> (BPA), best known for its use in rigid plastics but also present in some textile coatings. Studies have linked chronic BPA exposure to a range of metabolic and hormonal issues—including thyroid dysfunction, obesity, and insulin resistance [26,27,28].<br/></p><h3>Microplastics Found in Blood and Placenta</h3><p>One groundbreaking study from 2021 found <strong>microplastics embedded in human placental tissue</strong>, raising urgent concerns about fetal exposure during pregnancy and the potential risks for developmental health [29,30].<br/></p><p>In 2022, researchers in the Netherlands made another alarming discovery: <strong>microplastics in human blood</strong>, including particles of PET and polystyrene—materials commonly used in food packaging and synthetic fabrics [29].<br/></p><p>These findings suggest that <strong>microfibers </strong>are capable of <strong>crossing biological barriers</strong> once thought impermeable, with the potential to accumulate in organs such as the liver, kidneys, and brain.<br/></p><p>It’s a reminder that synthetic clothing doesn’t just stay on the surface—it interacts with the body at levels that science is only beginning to understand.<br/></p><h3>Oxidative Stress and Cellular Aging<br/></h3><p>Prolonged exposure to synthetic textiles may contribute to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134455\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>oxidative stress</strong></a>—a physiological imbalance between free radicals and the body’s natural antioxidant defenses [31]. This condition can quietly damage cells over time and is linked to a variety of long-term health issues.<br/></p><p>Specifically, oxidative stress has been associated with:<br/></p><ul><li>DNA fragmentation</li><li>Damage to proteins and lipids</li><li>Accelerated cellular aging</li><li>Inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders [31,32,33]</li></ul><p>Evidence from animal studies has shown that exposure to microplastics <strong>elevates markers of oxidative stress</strong>, while similar effects have been observed in <strong>human lung and gut cell cultures</strong> exposed to textile-derived fibers.</p>",

Children, Women, and Textile Workers<br/></h3><p>While synthetic fibers pose risks to everyone, <strong>certain groups are especially vulnerable </strong>due to their stage of development, daily environments, or levels of exposure.<br/></p><h3>Why Children Are More Vulnerable to Airborne Microplastics from Clothing</h3><p>Children breathe faster than adults and spend much of their time close to the ground—where dust and microfibers settle. As a result, <strong>they inhale up to three times more microplastics</strong> than adults on a daily basis [3,34].<br/></p><p>Their respiratory systems are still developing, which makes them more susceptible to inflammation and damage caused by airborne toxins. A study from the University of Oklahoma revealed that indoor environments—where children spend more than <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/microplastics3040040\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>90% of their time</strong></a>—are reservoirs of airborne microplastics, often from synthetic carpets, upholstery, and clothing [34].<br/></p><p>Potential health impacts include:<br/></p><ul><li>Worsening of asthma symptoms</li><li>Impaired development of the alveoli (air sacs in the lungs)</li><li>Disrupted immune function</li></ul><h3>How Synthetic Clothing Affects Women's Hormonal and Reproductive Health<br/></h3><p>Women may face greater exposure risks due to higher dermal contact with synthetic textiles—such as tight sportswear, underwear, and bras—particularly in warm or humid conditions.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Chemical additives in these fabrics, including <strong>phthalates and BPA</strong>, can act as <strong>xenoestrogens</strong>—chemicals that mimic or disrupt natural hormones [19,26,27,28,29]. Prolonged contact can interfere with hormonal signaling, potentially affecting reproductive health and increasing the risk of hormone-sensitive conditions.<br/></p><h3>Occupational Exposure to Synthetic Fibers: The Health Risks for Textile Workers<br/></h3><p>Those who manufacture, cut, or dye synthetic textiles often work in high-fiber concentration environments, where air ventilation is limited and exposure is constant.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Studies have shown that <strong>up to 4% of textile workers develop interstitial lung diseases</strong>, including fibrosis and chronic bronchitis, as a result of prolonged inhalation of fibers and exposure to chemical treatments used in textile production [35,36].<br/></p><h3>How to Build a Plastic-Free Wardrobe: Healthier Habits that Start with What You Wear</h3><ul><li><strong>Choose natural, breathable fabrics</strong> like 100% organic cotton or alpaca wool—especially for base layers, underwear, and activewear. These materials help minimize chemical absorption and allow your skin to breathe naturally.</li><li><strong>Avoid tight-fitting synthetic garments</strong>, particularly in warm or humid conditions. Friction and moisture retention can increase the risk of skin irritation, yeast infections, and bacterial imbalance.</li><li><strong>Wash clothes in cold water and air dry when possible.</strong> This reduces microfiber shedding by up to 80% and helps your garments last longer.</li><li><strong>Rinse new garments before wearing.</strong> This helps remove residual dyes, finishing agents, and formaldehyde that may still linger from production.</li><li><strong>Read clothing labels carefully. </strong>Be cautious with polyester, nylon, acrylic, and elastane—especially in intimate or skin-tight items.</li><li><strong>Avoid “moisture-wicking” synthetics</strong> during workouts if you’re prone to irritation. Natural fibers like alpaca offer high breathability and moisture management—without the chemical coatings.</li><li><strong>Support transparent, ethical brands</strong> that disclose their textile sources, avoid petroleum-based blends, and commit to truly sustainable practices.</li><li><strong>Share what you’ve learned. </strong>Host a clothing swap, talk to friends and family, or support community efforts to reduce plastic in fashion. Awareness grows through conversation.</li></ul><p>At <a href=\"https://armsofandes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Arms of Andes</strong></a>, we believe true performance supports both human health and ecological balance. That’s why we create garments from 100% natural alpaca wool and plastic-free—for those who move through life with purpose, and who refuse to wear what harms them.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>The truth is, synthetic clothing has long been marketed as the practical choice: affordable, quick-drying, high-performance. But behind every plastic thread lies a cost—to our bodies and to the planet.<strong><br/></strong></p><p>Every microfiber we inhale. Every drop of BPA our skin absorbs. Every synthetic wash cycle that releases invisible pollutants into the environment. These aren’t isolated incidents. They’re part of a system built on convenience, not consequence.<strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>If our clothes are making us sick, why is the industry still calling it performance?</strong></p>",
