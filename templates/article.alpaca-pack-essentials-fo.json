You can go from the beach in Rio to the highlands of Peru with just the clothes in your pack.<\/li><li><strong>Super soft<\/strong>: Clothes made with 100% royal alpaca wool are super soft to the touch, as the fibers are really fine and smooth. You won’t have to worry about itching, chafing or other annoyances.<\/li><li><strong>Durable<\/strong>: Despite being very fine, alpaca wool fibers have high tensile strength, making them durable and meaning clothes are less susceptible to pilling, rips and tears.<\/li><li><strong>Warm<\/strong>: In colder climates, alpaca keeps you toasty warm, especially when you layer it up.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Why Not Cotton or Merino Wool?<\/h3><p><strong>COTTON<\/strong><br\/>Cotton is a high quality natural fiber that is cheaper than both merino and alpaca, so you might be tempted to choose cotton clothing for your minimalist hiking pack. However, <strong>cotton absorbs moisture really easily and retains it<\/strong>, taking a long time to dry out. Further,<strong> cotton loses its thermal capacity when it’s wet, so it will stop keeping you warm<\/strong>. That means that if you sweat in your t-shirt as you climb a hill, as soon as you stop, you’ll feel the cold, clammy fabric against your skin and it may not dry out, even overnight at camp. Moist clothing can also rub against your skin, especially in where the straps of your backpack sit, so you could end up with chafing and irritation. <br\/><\/p><p><strong>MERINO WOOL<\/strong><br\/><strong>“But merino wool has all the same properties you listed above!<\/strong>”, you might say. And that’s true. The thing is, that alpaca wool fibers have a unique feature – semi-hollow cores – which means that <strong>alpaca outperforms merino<\/strong>. For example, like other wools, merino absorbs as much as 30% of its weight in water. On the other hand, alpaca absorbs less than 10% and instead wicks moisture  away from your body, keeping you dry.
