Your body heats these tiny pockets, providing added warmth. This makes <strong>our mid layer fleece jackets and hoodies <\/strong>perfect for cold conditions.<br\/><br\/><\/p><h3>MOISTURE-WICKING & BREATHABILITY<br\/><\/h3><p>Alpaca wool resists absorbing water—whether it’s sweat or light rain—and instead <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-12-824052-6.00010-X\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>wicks moisture away<\/strong><\/a> from your body [2,3].

With our <a href=\"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/pages\/fabric-weight-system\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>variety of fabric weights<\/strong><\/a> from 110gsm to 420gsm, you can tailor the weight and bulk of your hiking gear to your needs.<br\/><br\/><\/p><h3>ODOR RESISTANCE<\/h3><p>Sweat causes odor when bacteria break down particles in it, creating an unpleasant smell. Because <strong>alpaca wool is highly breathable and naturally antimicrobial<\/strong>, it prevents bacteria growth, keeping you odor-free even after intense hikes [3]. With <a href=\"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/products\/alpaca-wool-socks\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>alpaca wool socks<\/strong><\/a>, you can forget about stinky feet after a tough trail.<br\/><br\/><\/p><h3>WIND RESISTANCE<\/h3><p>Like sheep’s wool, alpaca is not very permeable to air [4]. Further, <strong>our thicker fabrics are tightly knit, allowing alpaca wool garments to act as wind barriers<\/strong>. Unless you expect heavy rain or extreme winds, you won’t need an additional windproof jacket.<br\/><br\/><\/p><h3>SUN PROTECTION<\/h3><p>Alpacas, adapted to the high solar radiation in the Peruvian Andes, produce <strong>wool that offers natural sun protection<\/strong> [5].
