But without the right gear, those dreamy nights can turn into a battle against the cold. If you've ever woken up shivering in your tent at 3 AM, you know how crucial it is to prepare properly. Whether you're a seasoned winter camper or heading out for your first cold-weather adventure, here’s everything you need to know about staying warm while you sleep [1].<br\/><\/p><h3>Choosing the Right Sleeping System for Winter Camping<br\/><\/h3><p>Your sleeping system is your first line of defense against freezing temperatures.
