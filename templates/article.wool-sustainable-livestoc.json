In this month that celebrates World Water Day, this is the perfect moment to critically examine the true sustainability of wool, focusing on waste, water use, energy consumption, and the global structure of the animal fiber market.<\/p><h3>Wool Waste and Environmental Impact: What Lies Beneath the Surface<\/h3><p>While wool is biodegradable, its lifecycle frequently ends in environmentally harmful ways. Up to <strong>100 million tons of textile waste<\/strong> are generated globally each year, with China alone contributing 40 million tons [1]. Of this total, wool makes up a substantial but poorly managed fraction. Theoretically, <strong>95% of textile waste is recyclable<\/strong>, yet recycling rates remain extremely low: <strong>less than 10% in China and just around 20% in Europe and the U.S<\/strong> [1].<\/p><p>Much of the discarded wool is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecoaya.com\/blogs\/sustainability\/clothing-landfills-pollution-fast-fashion\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>landfilled<\/strong><\/a> or incinerated. <strong>Landfilling wool<\/strong>, especially untreated wool, <strong>poses risks of soil contamination and bacterial hazards<\/strong> (e.g., anthrax spores), while incineration releases sulfur-rich greenhouse gases [1]. These realities complicate wool’s image as a green material.<\/p><p>Encouragingly, wool waste has potential as a valuable secondary resource. It can be repurposed into thermal and acoustic insulation, composite boards, or even used in water filtration systems to remove dyes and heavy metals. Chemically, <strong>wool waste can be transformed into keratin-based films and fertilizers, and even advanced biomaterials for wearable electronics<\/strong> [1].
