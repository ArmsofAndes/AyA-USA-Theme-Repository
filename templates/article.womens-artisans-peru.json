Despite colonial disruptions, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-9856.2011.00693.x\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Andean women preserved their textile knowledge</strong></a>, adapting techniques while maintaining ancestral designs and meanings [2]. Today, their weavings remain a form of storytelling, documenting myths, landscapes, and personal narratives through vibrant patterns and natural dyes [3].</p>",

Across the Peruvian Andes, female artisan groups form <strong>cooperatives and associations</strong> to access fair markets, improve economic stability, and preserve their traditions. Organizations like <strong>CIAP (Central Interregional de Artesanos del Perú)</strong> and <strong>Manuela Ramos</strong> provide artisans with training, raw materials, and access to international buyers, ensuring that their work reaches beyond local markets [4].<br/></p><p>However,<strong> financial stability remains a challenge</strong>. Many artisans struggle with seasonal demand fluctuations and income inequality within cooperatives, where access to orders and payments is often uneven [2]. Despite these obstacles, women continue to engage in textile production—not just for economic reasons, but for <strong>the social bonds and empowerment these groups offer</strong>.<br/></p><p>As many artisans express, <strong>belonging to a weaving collective is about more than just earning money—</strong><a href=\"https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/mujeres-legados-andes-peruanos\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>it is about sisterhood, self-worth, and community</strong></a> [4]. Weaving circles become safe spaces where women share experiences, support one another, and collectively navigate the challenges of rural life.<br/></p><h3>Cultural Guardians: The Women Who Preserve Andean Weaving</h3><p>One of the most influential figures in the preservation of Andean textiles is <strong>Nilda Callañaupa Álvarez</strong>, a Quechua weaver from Chinchero, Peru. As the founder of the <strong>Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (CTTC)</strong>, she has dedicated her life<strong> to reviving and promoting traditional weaving techniques</strong>, ensuring that future generations inherit and value their cultural heritage [5].<br/></p><p>Her work exemplifies the resilience and leadership of Andean women artisans, who often <strong>act as educators, activists, and cultural ambassadors</strong>. Through initiatives like CTTC, young Quechua girls are learning not only the technical skills of weaving but also the significance of their craft as a form of identity, resistance, and connection to the land.</p>",
