Materials like alpaca wool, merino, and other natural fibers are renewable and return to the Earth without polluting it.<br/></p><p>Recent studies show that these materials can perform well in <a href=\"https://armsofandes.com/blogs/news/5-reasons-why-alpaca-wool-is-essential-for-snowboarding\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>base and mid layers</strong></a>.
