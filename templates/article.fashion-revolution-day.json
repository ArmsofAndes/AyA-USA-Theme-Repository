For example, mixing ornamental wildflower seeds into a desert-area protest might inadvertently displace local flora. On balance these actions are low-cost and often beneficial—growing plants in lifeless spots—, but they must be done carefully [17,18].

In fact, Christo’s 1969 Wrapped Coast project in Australia left “no hint” on the landscape after removal – everything was recycled and the site restored [20]​.
