In Peru, this day holds profound significance. As one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, Peru is home to a staggering array of ecosystems and species [1]. From the arid coastal deserts to the lush <strong>Amazon rainforest<\/strong>, the country's diverse landscapes harbor an estimated <strong>10% of the world's species<\/strong>, including over <strong>25,000 plant species<\/strong> and more than <strong>1,800 bird species<\/strong> [2,3].<\/p><p>At the heart of this natural wealth lies Cusco, a region that epitomizes Peru's ecological richness. Beyond its renowned archaeological sites, Cusco's varied altitudes and climates create a mosaic of habitats teeming with life. From cloud forests to high-altitude grasslands, the region's biodiversity is both a national treasure and a global asset.<br\/><\/p><h3>Cusco: A Biodiversity Hotspot<\/h3><p>Cusco is often seen through the lens of its ruins—but step beyond the stone walls of Machu Picchu, and you'll find a region alive with one of the most astonishing biodiversity concentrations on the planet. <strong>Its dramatic topography—rising from low Amazonian edges to glacial Andean summits—<\/strong>creates a natural corridor where species from vastly different ecosystems coexist, evolve, and thrive.<\/p><p>This altitudinal range supports ecosystems as varied as <strong>humid montane cloud forests, puna grasslands, high-Andean wetlands (bofedales), and sub-tropical valleys<\/strong>. Each is home to species that have adapted to extremely specific microclimates, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. These aren’t isolated islands of life—they are deeply connected to the rhythms of local communities who have safeguarded them for generations.<\/p><p>One of the most iconic examples is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visitmanu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Manu Biosphere Reserve<\/strong><\/a>, which spans both Cusco and Madre de Dios. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unesco.org\/en\/mab\/manu\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Recognized by UNESCO<\/strong><\/a>, it is considered one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet. In just a single hectare, scientists have recorded more than 250 tree species. Manu shelters over 1,000 bird species, 200 mammal species, and countless insects, orchids, frogs, and felines—including the elusive jaguar and endangered giant river otter [4,5,6,7].

Among the most insidious of these is <strong>plastic pollution<\/strong>. From marketplaces in the city to trails deep in the Andes, single-use plastics find their way into rivers, wetlands, and soils. They choke waterways, entangle wildlife, and break down into microplastics that are absorbed by plants, eaten by animals, and, eventually, consumed by us.<br\/><\/p><p>In aquatic ecosystems—like the Andean wetlands that support native birds and amphibians—plastic debris is often mistaken for food.
