But what outdoor clothes did people wear before synthetic fibers were invented? Some of the earliest Antarctic explorers, like Roald Amundsen, braved freezing conditions without the advantage of modern extreme cold weather clothing. So how did they do it?<\/p><h3>What materials did they use?<\/h3><p>It came down to lots and lots of layers. At the time of Antarctic exploration, humans hadn’t invented synthetic materials, <strong>nylon was only first made in 1935<\/strong>. Their base layers were often made of wool, typically long john style underwear.

They opted for less animal fur clothing, instead used layers of wool and Burberry windproof fabric to keep out the cold. Amundsen won the race to the pole, arriving on the 14th of December 1911.<\/p><h3>Why did we switch to synthetics?<\/h3><p>Roald Amundsen and his Antarctic exploration team were racing to the south pole in the early 1900’s, a good 30 years before the creation of the first synthetic fabrics. Leaving them little choice as to what they could wear. However, <strong>modern winter enthusiasts almost always opt for synthetic materials <\/strong>over natural ones, why is that?<\/p><p>It’s due to a number of things. Primarily their insulative value. A synthetic jacket stuffed with down traps a great insulating layer of air around your body, which is going to keep you toasty warm.<\/p><p>Modern mountain climbers use full body suits made from synthetic materials. These suits can <strong>keep you warm in temperatures as low as -50⁰C<\/strong>, which would have been of great use to Amundsen and Scott. On top of their impressive insulative value, it’s also about weight. Modern materials like <strong>nylon and Gore-Tex are incredibly lightweight and strong<\/strong>, making them much more useful in tough environments.<\/p><p>Cost also had a lot to do with the shift. It is much easier to make massive amounts of petrochemical based fabrics like nylon and polyester, than it is for rear alpacas or sheep for their wool. However, <strong>the production methods used to make these synthetic fabrics have high environmental costs<\/strong>. Which is something worth considering now more than ever.<\/p><p>Synthetics are also very good at what they do. If you have ever been caught out in a rainstorm before, you probably have had silently praised your Gore-Tex layers for keeping you completely dry.<\/p>","custom_liquid":"","color":"#000000","font_size":18,"font_weight":300}}},"block_order":["text_3qUi6e"],"custom_css":[".richtext-full-bg {margin: 3% 8% 0 8%;}",".rte {line-height: 2em; letter-spacing: 0.5px; text-align: justify;}"],"name":"Rich text","settings":{"section_width":"full-width-row","text_width":"grid","text_position":"left","text_alignment":"left","color_bg":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_text":"#151515","color_links":"#151515","disable_top_spacing":true,"disable_bottom_spacing":true}},"image_with_text_zBmYpm":{"type":"image-with-text","blocks":{"text_fNeKEd":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<h3>Are synthetics better than natural materials?<\/h3><p>Well, not exactly. They each have their own advantages and <strong>we recommend combining them to get the most out of your outdoor experience<\/strong>. For example, it doesn’t make sense to use anything other than a synthetic outer jacket. Being completely wind and rain proof is a massive advantage for any outdoor enthusiast.<\/p><p>However, it is more convenient to wear natural fibers next to skin. If you have tried wearing <strong>alpaca wool as mid or base layers<\/strong>, you probably won’t wear synthetics next to skin ever again.
