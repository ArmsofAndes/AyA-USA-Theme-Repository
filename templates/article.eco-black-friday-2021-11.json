Is this an item that you would buy if it were full price? If not, you are most likely being conned into overbuying by purchasing more than what you realistically need.<\/p><h3>4. Be purposeful in gift giving<\/h3><p>Think to yourself whether the person you are buying for will genuinely use the gift. Does Aunt Sally really need another scarf? Is it something they have mentioned they need? Exchange holiday lists to make sure everyone is receiving something useful.<\/p><h3>5. Skip the cart<\/h3><p>When you get to the store, don’t grab a shopping cart. Walk past the $5 and under aisle and head straight to the items on your list. Try to avoid browsing through other aisles.
