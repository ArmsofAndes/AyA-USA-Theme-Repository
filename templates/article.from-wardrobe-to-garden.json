            "richtext": "<h3>Why Composting Wool?</h3><p>Wool stands out among textiles because of its natural keratin composition, a protein that microbes can digest<strong> over 6-12 months</strong>, allowing it to decompose under the right conditions [1,2,3].<br/><br/><strong>Composting wool contributes to environmental health in several ways.</strong> As wool breaks down into organic matter, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-024-05802-6\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>it releases valuable nutrients like nitrogen and sulfur</strong></a>, which fertilize the soil and promote plant growth [1,4]. Additionally, wool fibers improve soil stability by retaining moisture and reducing erosion, making it especially beneficial for arid or drought-prone soils [2]. In this way, giving back to the earth supports a circular economy and completes the product’s lifecycle.<br/><br/>Therefore, this process transforms it into a valuable resource rather than waste, reducing reliance on <a href=\"https://www.ecoaya.com/blogs/sustainability/clothing-landfills-pollution-fast-fashion\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>landfills</strong></a>. In landfills, <strong>natural decomposition is often hindered by compacted waste</strong>, lack of oxygen, and the presence of non-organic materials, leading to methane emissions—a potent greenhouse gas.<br/><br/><strong>However, not all wool is compostable.</strong> Wool blended with synthetic materials like polyester or acrylic is not biodegradable and should not be composted. Moreover, many wool textiles are treated with <a href=\"https://www.ecoaya.com/blogs/sustainability/naturally-dyed-organic-fibers-fast-fashion\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>heavy metal-based dyes</strong></a>, anti-shrink chemicals like chlorine, superwash coatings, or other finishes. These chemical treatments can <strong>slow biodegradation</strong> and potentially release <strong>harmful substances into the soil </strong>[2].<br/><br/>To ensure safe composting, it’s essential to choose untreated or minimally processed wool and understand <strong>how to properly prepare your garments for the process</strong>.</p>",
