In processed form, their fur is similar to sheep’s wool but softer and less itchy. <br\/><br\/>Measuring between 16 and 25 microns per strand, alpaca wool is most similar to cashmere, but with a lower price point.<br\/><br\/>Taking Arms of Andes clothing for example, which uses Royal Wool (the finest 1% of alpaca wool), you’ll feel just as comfortable in your summer activities as you would lounging around.<br\/><br\/>Alpaca wool is also lanolin-free and hypoallergenic.<br\/><br\/>What is lanolin you ask?<br\/><br\/>It’s a fatty substance produced by sheep which can cause skin irritation for those with sensitive skin. Since lanolin is a grease, being absent it also makes alpaca wool clothing easier to clean with a non-intensive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/zero-waste\/zero-waste-laundry-detergent\/\">eco friendly laundry detergent.<\/a><br\/><\/p><h3>ALPACA WOOL PROTECTS YOU FROM THE ELEMENTS<\/h3><p>Alpaca wool clothing won't just keep you comfortable because of its softness; it’ll also keep you comfortably protected from the harsh elements that come with hot weather.<\/p>","custom_liquid":"","color":"#4a4a4a","font_size":16,"font_weight":300}}},"block_order":["subheading_M9t9En","subheading_xt4Q8U","text_wEPTzF"],"custom_css":[".richtext-full-bg {margin: 3% 8% 0 8%;}",".rte {line-height: 2em; letter-spacing: 0.5px; text-align: justify;}","h3 {text-align: left;}",".subheading {letter-spacing: 0; text-transform: capitalize;}","@media screen and (max-width: 749px) {.rte, .custom-heading {font-size: 12px !important; }}"],"name":"Rich text","settings":{"section_width":"full-width-row","text_width":"grid","text_position":"left","text_alignment":"left","color_bg":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_text":"#4a4a4a","color_links":"#151515","disable_top_spacing":true,"disable_bottom_spacing":true}},"image_with_text_qTCCgz":{"type":"image-with-text","blocks":{"text_yPV379":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Each fiber contains microscopic air bubbles that wick moisture away from the skin, much like a sponge, and dries it quickly.

If mild pilling does occur, it can be removed with a soft brush.<br\/><br\/>It’s also wrinkle-resistant, stain-resistant (because the fibers don’t have raised scales like other wool), and odor-resistant, all of which amount to you needing to wash your alpaca wool garments less often.<br\/><br\/>If you’re looking for a hassle-free fabric to fill your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/sustainable-travel\/sustainable-eco-friendly-luggage\/\" target=\"_blank\">sustainable luggage <\/a>for your two-week vacation with limited laundry services, alpaca wool will keep you looking and smelling fresh for days on end.<br\/><br\/>While less delicate and easier to wash than other luxury fibers, when the time comes you should still wash as gently as possible in cold water and lay flat to dry to avoid shrinking or stretching.<\/p><h3>ALPACA WOOL IS LOW IMPACT<\/h3><p>Not only is alpaca wool one of the most durable and versatile fabrics in terms of qualities, it’s also one of the most sustainable, even <a href=\"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/pages\/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">compared to other natural fabrics<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>One way alpaca wool is more eco-friendly than many fibers used in summer garments (namely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/sustainable-fashion\/synthetic-fabrics\/\" target=\"_blank\">synthetic fabrics<\/a>) is that it is biodegradable, depending on what it’s combined and processed with, of course.<br\/><br\/>Considering most alpaca wool is processed by indigenous communities, it’s largely dyed naturally using plants and insects, meaning toxic dyes shouldn’t be the reason you can’t toss those holey wool leggings in your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/sustainable-living\/indoor-compost-bins\/\" target=\"_blank\"> home compost bin.<\/a><br\/><br\/>Especially considering alpaca fiber contains special proteins which allow the hairs to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/zero-waste\/biodegradable-vs-compostable\/\" target=\"_blank\">biodegrade<\/a> in an even shorter time than other wools.<br\/><br\/>The animals themselves also have a far smaller hoofprint than other wool-producing herd animals.<br\/><br\/>Whereas <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/sustainable-fashion\/ethical-cashmere\/\" target=\"_blank\">cashmere<\/a> goats destroy the land on which they roam, leading to major desertification in the fragile Mongolian ecosystem, alpacas roam the Peruvian highlands, a hearty and resilient ecosystem.<br\/><br\/>Unlike cashmere goats, they’re light eaters (meaning they leave the roots of their food intact to regrow and don’t eat as much) and consume little water.<br\/><br\/>Rather than sharp hooves, alpacas have padded feet so they don’t destroy the soil. In fact, they actually support it by gently tilling the land as they walk, promoting new growth.<\/p><h3>ALPACA WOOL IS ETHICAL<\/h3><p>Beyond all that, alpaca is just about the most ethical wool available.<br\/><br\/>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/cfda.com\/resources\/materials\/detail\/alpaca\" target=\"_blank\">The Council of Fashion Designers of America Material Index<\/a>, “For the most part, animal rights are not a big problem when it comes to alpaca production.”<br\/><br\/>Unlike other animal fibers sourced through mass farming, alpacas are raised free-range in their natural Andean habitat.<br\/><br\/>In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/andina.pe\/ingles\/noticia-peru-biggest-alpaca-fiber-producer-in-the-world-677500.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">80% <\/a>of all alpaca wool comes from Peru, and 85% of that from small, indigenous farming communities that keep the alpacas alive as long as possible and do not kill the animals for their wool.<br\/><br\/>While merino wool is often associated with a shearing practice known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peta.org\/issues\/animals-used-for-clothing\/wool-industry\/mulesing\/\" target=\"_blank\">mulesing<\/a>, the once-annual alpaca shearing process takes only about 5 minutes and keeps the alpaca healthy for the rest of their roaming.<br\/><br\/>On your next woodsy outing, enjoy both the outer peace of nature and the inner peace of knowing your outfit helps promote animal welfare.<\/p><h3>FINAL THOUGHTS ON ALPACA WOOL<\/h3><p>Whether you’re looking for a<a href=\"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/products\/womens-alpaca-wool-v-neck-shirt\" target=\"_blank\"> simple t-shirt <\/a>to keep you covered at the beach or to curate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sustainablejungle.com\/sustainable-fashion\/what-is-slow-fashion\/\" target=\"_blank\">a slow fashion<\/a> wardrobe for that big summer trip, you can’t go wrong by choosing alpaca from <a href=\"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/pages\/our-values\" target=\"_blank\">a responsible brand<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>Especially considering that its eco-friendly nature will help keep those oceans blue and hills green for many summers to come.<\/p>","custom_liquid":"","color":"#4a4a4a","font_size":16,"font_weight":300}}},"block_order":["text_t6mjfQ"],"custom_css":[".richtext-full-bg {margin: 3% 8% 0 8%;}",".rte {line-height: 2em; letter-spacing: 0.5px; text-align: justify;}","a {color: #ed7332; text-decoration: none;}"],"name":"Rich text","settings":{"section_width":"full-width-row","text_width":"grid","text_position":"left","text_alignment":"left","color_bg":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","color_text":"#4a4a4a","color_links":"#151515","disable_top_spacing":true,"disable_bottom_spacing":true}},"gallery_wpfaf9":{"type":"gallery","blocks":{"image_4HdV8g":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/pf-39082e30--IMG5699-1-Edited-1.webp","subheading":"","title":"","text":"","link_label":"SHOP WOMEN'S","link":"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/collections\/womens-alpaca-wool-clothing","use_text_button":false,"block_link":"","product_list":[]}},"image_3zjK9m":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/pf-34d7fad7--IMG5698-2-Edited.webp","subheading":"","title":"","text":"","link_label":"SHOP MEN'S","link":"https:\/\/armsofandes.com\/collections\/mens-alpaca-wool-clothing","use_text_button":false,"block_link":"","product_list":[]}}},"block_order":["image_4HdV8g","image_3zjK9m"],"custom_css":[".gallery__inner {display: grid !important; gap: 1rem;}",".gallery {padding-left: 1.8rem; padding-right: 1.8rem;}",".aspect-ratio {--ratio-percent: 49% !important;}",".gallery.custom-gallery img {object-fit: cover; height: 100%; width: 100%;}",".button {background-color: rgb(14, 37, 94); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px; padding: 15px 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-weight: 700; border: none;}"],"name":"Gallery","settings":{"columns_desktop":2,"section_width":"grid","mobile_swipe":false,"image_ratio":"adapt","content_position":"middle-center","text_alignment":"center","column_spacing":"small","heading_size":"h2","overlay_color":"#000000","overlay_opacity":0,"disable_top_spacing":false,"disable_bottom_spacing":false}}},"order":["breadcrumbs","main-article","image_with_text_overlay_pJi79Q","rich_text_GpWLNc","image_with_text_qTCCgz","image_with_text_QBc33n","rich_text_wbC6eC","gallery_wpfaf9"]}
