Below are a few tips:<br\/><\/p><ul><li>Since alpaca wool is odor resistant, you shouldn’t need to wash it too regularly. <strong>Airing out or rinsing in clean water is usually enough.<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Our clothes are now machine washable<\/strong>, but make sure to use a cold water, gentle cycle and a mild detergent to ensure they last as long as possible.<\/li><li>The dye will likely tint the washing water, <strong>so wash with similar colors only<\/strong>, but don’t worry, the color of your garment won’t be changed.<br\/><\/li><li>When drying, it’s best to lie the garment flat, out of direct sunlight. Tumble drying should be avoided as it likely will shrink your clothes, but alpaca wool dries pretty quickly anyway!<\/li><li>If you feel it’s necessary, you can iron your alpaca wool clothes on a warm setting. <\/li><li>The wool and dyes are affected by chemicals, so you should avoid dry cleaning and using fabric softeners or bleach.  <\/li><li><strong>We recommend washing your naturally dyed clothing less often,<\/strong> to help the unique color last as long as possible.<\/li><\/ul><p>Please note that the garments in our Natrual Colors Line are hand-dyed in small batches, so no one else will have exactly the same color as you! Natural dyes are environmentally friendly, gentle on the skin and pleasing to the eye, but they are less good at bonding with textile fibers, so colors can bleed a little when your wash your clothes, or sweat in them. Therefore, we recommend using your naturally dyed garments with dark clothing or equipment (e.g. backpacks) and washing with similar colors, especially at the beginning. Natural dyes may show some unevenness in coloring, but this is how nature works!
