If you wonder what exactly it means and how it defines the fiber quality and price, let's find out with us.<\/p><h2>What is a micron in wool?<\/h2><p>Micron is a small measuring unit. One micron is equal to one millionth of a meter. This measuring unit is used to measure the <strong>diameter of wool fibres<\/strong>.

However, this does not mean that fibers below 20 microns cannot be used for outer layers.<\/p><p>You can find alpaca wool jumpers and merino wool sweaters of less than 20 microns. Because of the way the garment is knitted, the garment can still provide a great amount of warmth while being naturally lightweight.<\/p><p>Typically, fibers of 20 microns and below are used for garments next to skin, such as wool base layers, super base layers, underwear, socks, tank tops, etc.<\/p><h2>What is the difference in touch?<\/h2><p>Finer wool of alpaca or merino means a softer touch and less itchiness.
