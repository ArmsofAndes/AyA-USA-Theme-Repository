Archaeozoological data suggests that the alpaca descends from the wild vicuña, while its cousin, the llama, was domesticated from the guanaco [3]. Both species were central to the development of early Andean societies, though their roles diverged: llamas for transport, alpacas for their fine fleece.<\/p><p>These early communities didn’t simply tame animals—they built relationships. They observed, adapted, and over time, bred creatures that could thrive in the thin, oxygen-poor air of the altiplano. Genetic studies show alpacas developed traits like <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s13059-020-02080-6\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>hypoxia resistance and dense fleece<\/strong><\/a> to survive in these extreme conditions [1].<\/p><p><strong>The Sacred Valley<\/strong>, with its wet grasslands and elevated terrain, <strong>provided an ideal environment for alpaca domestication<\/strong>.
