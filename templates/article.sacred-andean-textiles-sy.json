These cords documented census data, agricultural inventories, and possibly even poetic expression [3]. Though not “read” in the alphabetic sense, they were touched, counted, and understood—bridging memory and governance.<\/p><p>Today, in remote communities, the practice of storytelling through cloth continues.
